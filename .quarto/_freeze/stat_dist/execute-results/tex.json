A widely used approach is to analyze the distribution of data, also to compare data sets with each other. In the following sections this aspect will be discussed.\n\n## Absolute and relative frequencies\n\nIn statistics, the frequency of a given event is the number of times the specific event occurred. In this first part of the section, we will distinguish between relative frequency and absolute frequency.\n\n**Absolute frequency**\n\nThe absolute frequency in simply the number of times that a value appears. Therefore, the sum of all absolute frequencies is the total number of data.\n\n$$\nf_{1} + f_{2} + f_{3} + … + f_{n} = N\n$$\n\nIn a more compact way:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i = N\n$$\n\n**Relative frequency**\n\nThe relative frequency is obtained by dividing the absolute frequencies by the total number of data. Therefore, the sum of all relative frequencies is equal to 1. More formally:\n\n$$\nn_i = \\frac{f_i}{N}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Biological focus: Monoclonal antibody\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies are a class of proteins designed in the laboratory in order to be able to bind specific targets. There are many types of monoclonal antibodies, but their common feature is that they can bind only one antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are often used in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including some types of cancer.\n\nAs an example, we focus our attention on the monoclonal antibody for the influenza virus. More specifically, the crystal structure of the complex between neuraminidase from influenza virus (subtype N9 and isolated from an avian source) and the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of monoclonal antibody NC41 has been refined (pdb code: 1NCA).\n\n:::\n\nTo better elucidate both the absolute and relative frequency concept, we analyze a specific biological problem. Here, the analysis of the contacts is performed for the case of a specific monoclonal antibody, which has been designed for the neuraminidase from influenza virus (pdb code: 1NCA). To this end, we define two residues in contact if the distance between their c-alpha atoms have a distance less than $12 Å$.\n\nFirst of all, it is useful to describe the organization of the pdb file, which contains the information relating to the three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) of each atom of the protein.\n\nBelow, we report the first rows of the *1nca* pdb file corresponding to the first c-alpha atoms of the protein.\n\n<small style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  type eleno elety  alt resid chain resno insert      x      y       z o     b\n1 ATOM     1     N <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 72.652  8.334 153.945 1 50.23\n2 ATOM     2    CA <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 72.021  8.573 155.230 1 47.94\n3 ATOM     3     C <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 71.384  7.213 155.534 1 45.77\n4 ATOM     4     O <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 71.369  6.388 154.609 1 46.15\n5 ATOM     5    CB <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 71.017  9.779 155.073 1 48.24\n6 ATOM     6   CG1 <NA>   ILE     N    81   <NA> 70.453 10.145 156.446 1 49.92\n  segid elesy charge\n1  <NA>     N   <NA>\n2  <NA>     C   <NA>\n3  <NA>     C   <NA>\n4  <NA>     O   <NA>\n5  <NA>     C   <NA>\n6  <NA>     C   <NA>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</small>\n\nFor each atom we have a set of information:\n\n-   type of atom\n\n-   number of each element\n\n-   atom name. Each atom in the structure of each residue is named with a specific nomenclature.\n\n-   amino acid name (for example Ile, Arg, Asp, etc.)\n\n-   the chain of belonging of each atom\n\n-   the residue number\n\n-   the coordinates of each atom (x, y and z)\n\n-   B-factor\n\n-   type of atom, for example: C, N, O etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dim='[3.5,3.5]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Using the `image` function of R, we report the contact matrix of the antibody present in the 1nca pdb file.

Interestingly, by analyzing the Figure @fig-contactResidues is possible to note regions of the protein with a high number of contacts and regions with low number of contacts.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dim='[8,4]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![For each residue the number of contacts is shown.

We increase the value of $n$ by adding 1 contacts to each step of the procedure. In the following table we report the absolute frequencies, i.e. how many residues have 0 contacts, how many residues have 1 contact, how many residues have 2 contacts, and so on.\n\n<small style=\"font-size: 10px\">\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n1  1  2  2  3  6  4  5  9  6 17 14 14 16 19 18 10 14 16 17 14\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53\n1 12 16 16 21 21 11 19 12 17 15 11  4 10  7  4 10  3  4  5  4  4  1  1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</small>\n\nFor both tables the second row is \"how many residues\" and the first row is \"have n contacts\". For example, we observe that there 19 residue interacting with 8 residues, as well as, there is 1 residue interacting with 44 residues.\n\nAs described above, we calculate the relative frequency by dividing each element of absolute frequency by the total number of contacts.\n\n<small style=\"font-size: 10px\">\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      10     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21\n1 0.0023 0.0046 0.0046 0.0069 0.0138 0.0092 0.0115 0.0207 0.0138 0.0391 0.0322\n      22     23     24     25\n1 0.0322 0.0368 0.0437 0.0414\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     26     27     28     29     30     31     32     33     34     35     36\n1 0.023 0.0322 0.0368 0.0391 0.0322 0.0276 0.0368 0.0368 0.0483 0.0483 0.0253\n      37     38     39     40\n1 0.0437 0.0276 0.0391 0.0345\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      41     42    43     44     45    46     47     48     49     50     51\n1 0.0253 0.0092 0.023 0.0161 0.0092 0.023 0.0069 0.0092 0.0115 0.0092 0.0092\n      52     53\n1 0.0023 0.0023\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</small>\n",
