# Introduction

To illustrate the importance of studying data correctly to obtain reliable conclusions, let's consider an example. In Italy, between 10/12/2021 and 09/01/2022, the rate of hospitalizations in intensive care due to COVID-19 for non-vaccinated individuals (age-standardized for the population aged ≥ 12 years) was 35.6 per 100000 inhabitants. In contrast, for vaccinated individuals with a full cycle of ≤ 120 days, the same index was 2.0 per 100000 inhabitants (data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS). This result suggests that the rate of hospitalization in intensive care for unvaccinated individuals is about eighteen times higher than for vaccinated individuals.

However, this is only a partial conclusion. To better understand the effect of vaccination on hospitalization, we need to know the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. This ratio is essential in interpreting the data since the distribution of people between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups affects the conclusion. If the ratio is around one, the previous conclusion has a certain interpretation. But if the ratio is near to zero, where the number of vaccinated individuals is much greater than the number of unvaccinated individuals, the data have a different weight, and the effect of vaccination is much more significant.

This example demonstrates the importance of reading, manipulating, and drawing conclusions from data correctly.

In the field of biochemistry, a fundamental aspect of studying proteins is to understand their properties and functions. However, analyzing proteins involves handling and analyzing complex data, which requires a strong foundation in data handling and analysis.

One example of the importance of data analysis in protein research is the statistical analysis of the chemical and physical properties of proteins. By using statistical methods, patterns and trends can be identified in these properties, such as molecular weight, charge, and hydrophobicity. These analyses can help identify common characteristics among different types of proteins and provide insights into their functions and behaviors.

Another example is the comparative analysis of protein stability. Proteins can have different levels of thermal stability, and understanding these differences is critical to many areas of study. By comparing the thermal stability of different proteins, factors that contribute to stability can be identified and this information can be used to design more stable proteins for a range of applications.

In addition to these examples, data analysis is essential for studying protein-protein interactions, predicting protein structures, and many other areas of study in biochemistry. With the growing field of bioinformatics and computational biology, the ability to handle and analyze large data sets has become increasingly important in this field.

In conclusion, having skills in data handling and analysis is crucial for studying proteins in biochemistry. By understanding these skills, complex data can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends, make meaningful comparisons between different proteins, and gain insights into their functions and behaviors. Ultimately, these skills are essential for advancing our understanding of proteins and their role in biochemistry.

The course will cover the basic concepts of statistics, data analysis, and data visualization using specific examples of data relating to biological systems. Practical examples will be reported in the R programming language.
